#  Unsupervised Learning for AR/VR Systems

This repository contains six independent yet connected tasks showcasing the use of **unsupervised machine learning** techniques in the context of **Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR)**. Each task is implemented from scratch using Python and popular libraries like `scikit-learn`, `OpenCV`, and `matplotlib`.

##  Task Implementations

### Task 1: 2D Clustering Comparison (K-Means vs DBSCAN)
**Objective:** Evaluate clustering performance on synthetic datasets  
**Key Insights:**  
- K-Means excels with globular clusters but fails on moon-shaped data
- DBSCAN handles irregular shapes and noise robustly
- Parameter tuning (`eps`/`min_samples`) is critical for density-based methods

### Task 2: Image Segmentation via Color Clustering
**Objective:** Partition images using pixel color grouping  
**Discoveries:**  
- Optimal clusters (k=4-6) balance detail and simplicity
- LAB color space outperforms RGB for perceptual segmentation
- Segmentation creates effective "region masks" for object isolation

### Task 3: High-Dimensional Data Visualization
**Objective:** Visualize feature spaces using PCA/t-SNE  
**Findings:**  
- PCA preserves global structure but loses local relationships
- t-SNE reveals nonlinear patterns (ideal for cluster separation)
- Perplexity tuning dramatically impacts t-SNE layout quality

### Task 4: Sensor Activity Clustering
**Objective:** Detect motion patterns from accelerometer/gyroscope data  
**Learnings:**  
- Feature engineering (magnitude, variance) improves cluster quality
- PCA preprocessing (95% variance) enhances both K-Means/DBSCAN
- Inertial sensors provide rich clustering signals for AR navigation

### Task 5: AR Object Overlay Simulation
**Objective:** Simulate AR bounding box detection  
**Breakthroughs:**  
- K-Means segmentation enables contour-based object detection
- Morphological operations clean segmentation artifacts
- OpenCV pipeline achieves 15 FPS - viable for real-time AR

### Task 6: Production Segmentation Workflow
**Objective:** Implement industry-grade segmentation pipeline  
**Adaptations:**  
- Integrated [python_for_microscopists](https://github.com/bnsreenu/python_for_microscopists) repo
- Handled large datasets via on-demand resizing
- Established modular preprocessing pipeline  
**Dataset Note:** Large files excluded due to GitHub's 50MB limit - resize inputs locally

### Key Learnings

1. **Task 1**: Understood how KMeans clusters circular data well, while DBSCAN excels with arbitrary shapes and noise resilience.

2. **Task 2**: Learned to segment images by grouping similar pixel colors using KMeans, offering insight into unsupervised visual understanding.

3. **Task 3**: Observed how dimensionality reduction reveals structure in high-dimensional data; PCA preserves variance, t-SNE reveals local groupings.

4. **Task 4**: Gained experience in preprocessing sensor data and applying clustering to detect patterns without labelsâ€”critical for AR motion analysis.

5. **Task 5**: Integrated clustering with visualization by overlaying detected regions on images, simulating AR-like object grouping.

6. **Task 6**: Explored a real-world GitHub repository, ran KMeans-based segmentation locally, and understood typical project structure and limitations (e.g., file size constraints).
